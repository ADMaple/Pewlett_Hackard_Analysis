# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Project Overview
I've been working with Bobby from Pewlett Hackard to analyze employee data, breaking down employee names, departments, titles, and tenure. Bobby's manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. I have provided a written report that summarizes the analysis to help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Resourses
-Data Source: departments.csv, employees.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
-Software: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Python, Visual Studio Code, Git Bash

## Analysis of Data
For this analysis I had to use Database Keys to establish the relationship between multiple tables, for this I focused on the Primary and Foreign Keys.
I used an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to help with highlighting the relationships between each of the tables. Once each of the tables were joined together, I was then able to create the tables needed to help show the retiring employees by title and identify the employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. 

## Results of Data
Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

These results show that 133,776 employees that could retire and also provides their title. 
See the breakdown by title below:
32,452 Staff
29,415 Senior Engineer
14,221 Engineer
8,047 Senior Staff
4,502 Technique Leader
1,761 Assistant Engineer

Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

There were a total of 1,940 employees eligible for the mentorship program. 

##Summary 
After analyzing the data to provide for Bobby to present to his managers, I believe this information will help with forcasting how many retirees to prepare for. They will also be able to predict and plan a hiring campaign from this data to fill the turnover from retirements.
