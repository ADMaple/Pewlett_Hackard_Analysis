# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Project Overview
I've been working with Bobby from Pewlett Hackard to analyze employee data, breaking down employee names, departments, titles, and tenure. Bobby's manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. I have provided a written report that summarizes the analysis to help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Resourses


## Analysis of Data
For this analysis I had to use Database Keys to establish the relationship between multiple tables, for this I focused on the Primary and Foreign Keys.


## Results of Data
Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
